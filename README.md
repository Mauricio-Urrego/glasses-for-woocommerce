# glasses-for-woocommerce
Drop-in AI assisted store creation. Ever wanted a robot to open an e-commerce shop for you? This is what that would look like.

Image, title, and description creation is thanks to OpenAI's [API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)
Color identification is thanks to the wonderful [algorithm](https://github.com/pixelogik/ColorCube) by Ole Krause-Sparman and my [port](https://github.com/Mauricio-Urrego/colorcube-php) of this algorithm from the original Python to the translated PHP.

## Developer Installation
Simply clone into wordpress plugins folder, run ```composer install``` inside newly created glasses-for-woocommerce folder and then activate the plugin.

## Who is this plugin for?
Have a large product list in need of descriptions or images? Don't even have products but want an idea of what your store might look like? Let the plugin do the leg work for you.
