What if an intelligent AI opened an e-commerce shop with optimized SEO. Let OpenAI come up with product titles, images, prices, descriptions, and colors for you from scratch. Or add to already existing products!

== Description ==

A very smart AI that can create products for your WooCommerce store. Can generate images, descriptions, prices, titles, and even colors.

Requires an OpenAI account for now. Although the developer is working on an api key-free version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it take long to process my products? =

Not at all! If it is taking longer than expected then please report a bug ;)

= Why don't the colors have human names assigned to them like red, blue, or green? =

There are many shades of different colors and perhaps your branding calls for different ways of naming them. There will be more support for default names in the future but for now they will be given in a hex form to more easily get started and to be one size fits all. After all, this is the way robots see colors.

== Screenshots ==

1. Creating an AI generated store.
2. Adding an AI generated product.
3. The home screen.
4. Here is an example of a very human product it can create ;) This is a joke, remember, it's still a robot making this! But isn't that incredible?
5. Bulk/individual editing of existing products.
