What if a robot AI opened an e-commerce store.

If there is a feature you would like included please let the developer know!

The developer is working on product variations and the key-less version right now but if there is anything else needed, perhaps it can move up in priority.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it take long to process my products? =

Not at all! If it is taking longer than expected then please report a bug ;)

= Why don't the colors have human names assigned to them like red, blue, or green? =

There are many shades of different colors and perhaps your branding calls for different ways of naming them. There will be more support for default names in the future but for now they will be given in a hex form to more easily get started and to be one size fits all. After all, this is the way robots see colors.
