Identifies the dominant color in your woocommerce products auto-magically. With plans to automate other tasks.

== Description ==

Identifies the dominant color in your woocommerce products auto-magically. With plans to automate other tasks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it take long to process my products? =

If you have a lot of products please give it some time to work, it will let you know when it is complete. If it is taking longer than expected then please report a bug. We'll add a progress bar soon ;)

= Why don't the colors have human names assigned to them like red, blue, or green? =

There are many shades of different colors and perhaps your branding calls for different ways of naming them. There will be more support for default names in the future but for now they will be given in a hex form to more easily get started and to be one size fits all.

== Screenshots ==

1. Just click process colors and take a well deserved break. We'll handle it from here :)
2. This is what it should look like when it is done. You can change the color names from the default hex names to your own color names. You can also see which products have been assigned these colors.
